Imagine a science lab run by artists and designers. Science for poets was a course offered to the students of Srishti Schoool of Art, Design and Technology.

In this course we looked at ways in which one can build a science lab and conduct experiments in biological engineering, genetic engineering and ecological sciences. At the end of the course, students designed,built and constructed their own organisms. They also focused on looking at designing biosensors to detect pollutants in water.

It was a collaboration between organizations and scientists from (NCBS) India and Bio-Design. They also looked at ways to partner with NGO’s and activists to implement and test those sensors.

BIO-DESIGN for the REAL WORLD is an interdisciplinary and collaborative research project to define, build, and field-test prototypes that required the integration of wetware, hardware, and software to address real world water problems. It is a partnership between (ART)ScienceBLR with design students from the Srishti School of Art, Design & Technology, (Bangalore, India) the Lifepatch citizen initiative in art, science and technology (Yogyakarta, Indonesia) and students at the School of Life Sciences at L’École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) (Lausanne, Switzerland).
