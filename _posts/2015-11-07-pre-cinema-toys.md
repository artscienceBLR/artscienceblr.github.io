Pre-Cinema toys was a 10 day course which looked at the origins of modern images.. The participants started by making their own cameras and exploring analog image making techniques. They then made different optical toys to understand the basic principles of moving images and early film. By studying devices which existed before cinema, the participants were encouraged to make their own.
