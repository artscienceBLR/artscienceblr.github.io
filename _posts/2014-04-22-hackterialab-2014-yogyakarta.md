HackteriaLab 2014 was a creative development and research phase in Yogyakarta, Indonesia, where a highly interdisciplinary and multicultural group collaboratively worked and shared their knowledge with various networks of local artists and institutions, as well as a public audience. The nodes of the projects were based on ongoing activities by Lifepatch with actual conditions in three ecologies, bioremediation of volcanic soil on Mount Merapi, water monitoring and sanitation in Code River and biodiversity conservation in Wonosadi Forest.
