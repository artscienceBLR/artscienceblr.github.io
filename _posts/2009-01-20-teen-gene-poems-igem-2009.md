(Art)ScienceBLR participated in the International Genetically Engineered Machines (iGEM) competition organised by MIT, USA. It worked with art and design students from the Srishti School of Art, Design and Technology under the guidance of artists, designers and scientists. As an exploration of the poetic promises and perils of synthetic biology, these projects addressed many ethical and philosophical questions. These questions, of course, are not new and relate to the very nature of technology itself. Most remain unanswered, and are still vague and ambiguous.
