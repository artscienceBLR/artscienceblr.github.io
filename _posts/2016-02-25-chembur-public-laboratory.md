At the end of the  DIYlab workshop at HBCSE, TIFR, Mumbai, we brought out all the instruments that were built to set up a public lab at the Chembur Naka. Chembur Naka is a very busy intersection in Chembur, Mumbai. The intersection also has a monorail station, a bus stop and other public transport. We were permitted to use the storefront of a telecommunication/mobile shop to set up our lab.
