“I Sing the Body Electric;

The armies of those I love engirth me, and I engirth them;

They will not let me off till I go with them, respond to them,

And discorrupt them, and charge them full with the charge of the Soul.”

Walt Whitman, 1900

I sing the body electric was a project based course offered at Srishti by (Art)ScienceBLR in collaboration with the textile department. The project looked at the broad range of raw materials that are used to create textiles and artifacts that react to the environment. The participants worked with artists, designers and activists and used smart fabrics, sensors and electronics to design and create textiles that are an interface between the body and the external world. At the end of the project, the students developed an understanding of the tools and techniques used to create responsive, reactive environments. This project was aimed at performance artists, product designers, textile designers and anyone wanting to create new interfaces and experiences.
